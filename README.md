# Hi, Unbreathable here!
I love networked system design and decentralization which is why I've been working on [Liphium](https://liphium.com).

**Languages I know**: 
- German (came built in on first boot)
- English (was aquired because of extensive youtube watching)
- Japanese (currently learning because I'm watching way too much anime)
- Golang (because it's the best for fast networked systems)
- Java- and TypeScript (you just have to learn it for web dev, even if you don't like it, like me)
- Dart (Flutter is just the best way to make a cross-platform app)
- Java (Minecraft Plugins *require* it, just replace your Java with Go already, even JS is better)
- GDScript (a little, cool, but missing proper editor support, like go to definition and stuff)
- C# (a little, Unity I still hate you)
- Rust (*trying* to learn how to fight the borrow checker, maybe I should learn how to build a weapon to fight it instead)

**App I'm currently working on**: https://liphium.com (or https://github.com/Liphium)

**Frameworks and tools**: 
- Flutter (please never die, I love you way too much)
- Fiber (that fast Go http framework that doesn't have HTTP/2 support yet)
- GORM (one of the best ORM libraries I've had to deal with, no code gen, thanks!)
- Hugo (best static site generator, very feature rich and stuff, but I hate theming it)
- VS Code (if you add one more AI feature I will kill Copilot.. in Minecraft)
- Godot (when I attend game jams, good for making good games quickly)
